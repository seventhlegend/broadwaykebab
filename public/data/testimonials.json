Tender, juicy, and packed with taste. The service was friendly and efficient, adding to an already great experience. Highly recommend if you're in the area and craving some delicious BBQ! ðŸ’¯",

      "text": "First time visiting Broadway BBQ and nice to visit at Turkish restaurant in Tooting. We went on a Wednesday when there was a 50% offer on mains. We got a mixed cold starters came with warm breads, lamb chops and a plate of lamb shawarma. Overall the food was good, the lamb was slightly dry and lacked some flavour, but the chops were good. The staff were friendly and attentive.",

The BBQ was amazing and are very generous portions. Every dish came out hot and when it was ready. We had the pleasure of meeting the owner Zozy, who made sure all our needs were catered to.",

As soon as I checked the menu, a lovely lady named Zozy warmly welcomed me, which made a great first impression. The food was fresh, well-prepared, and tasted great. Plus, it was quite affordable for the quality and portion size. The restaurant itself has a lovely atmosphere with beautiful decorations and nice music.",

Friendly and welcoming staff, great atmosphere, fantastic food and it was 50% off on all mains due to midweek discount! I will definitely become a regular here, such a shame I can't give them 6 stars.",

Amazing service and the food was exceptional. Tastiest chips ever! Delicious freshly grilled meats, the wraps were soft and tasty, the bulgar wheat and dips all outstanding.",
